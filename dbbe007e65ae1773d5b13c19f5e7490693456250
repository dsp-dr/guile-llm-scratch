MILESTONE: Core LLM Implementation - 2025-08-20

COMPONENTS IMPLEMENTED:
1. Tensor Operations (tensor.scm)
   - Efficient array operations using SRFI-4 f32vectors
   - Broadcasting, reshaping, slicing support
   - Matrix multiplication and reductions
   - Foundation for all neural network computations

2. BPE Tokenizer (tokenizer.scm)
   - Byte-pair encoding implementation from scratch
   - Training algorithm for vocabulary creation
   - Encode/decode with special token support
   - Model persistence for trained tokenizers

3. Attention Mechanisms (attention.scm)
   - Scaled dot-product attention
   - Multi-head attention with head splitting
   - Positional encoding (sinusoidal)
   - Various masking patterns (causal, sliding window, sparse)

4. Transformer Architecture (transformer.scm)
   - Complete encoder/decoder stacks
   - Feed-forward networks with GELU/ReLU
   - Layer normalization and residual connections
   - Text generation with temperature sampling

DESIGN DECISIONS:
- Pure Scheme implementation without external dependencies
- SRFI-4 for memory-efficient numeric arrays
- Functional approach with immutable operations where possible
- Literate programming for documentation and maintainability

TESTING:
- All modules include SRFI-64 test suites
- Tests cover basic operations and integration scenarios
- Run with: gmake test (after tangling)

PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS:
- Using f32vectors for better memory efficiency
- Row-major ordering for cache optimization
- Future: Consider FFI to BLAS/LAPACK for production
- Future: GPU acceleration via CUDA/OpenCL bindings

PARALLEL WORK OPPORTUNITIES:
- Optimization module (SGD, Adam, learning rate schedules)
- Training loop implementation with backpropagation
- Dataset loading and batching utilities
- Model serialization and checkpointing
- Evaluation metrics and visualization

NEXT STEPS:
1. Implement automatic differentiation for backprop
2. Add training loop with loss functions
3. Create data pipeline for text datasets
4. Build example models (GPT-nano for testing)
5. Performance profiling and optimization

STATUS: Core architecture complete, ready for training implementation
