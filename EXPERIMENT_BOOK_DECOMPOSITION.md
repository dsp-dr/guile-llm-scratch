# Experiment: Book-Driven Multi-Agent Development

## Hypothesis
A complex technical book can be efficiently implemented by decomposing it into parallel work streams, with each specialized agent focusing on specific chapters and delivering corresponding code modules.

## Experimental Design

### Input
- **Book**: "Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch)" (370 pages)
- **Target**: Pure Guile Scheme implementation
- **Agents**: 4 Claude Code instances working in parallel
- **Coordinator**: 1 Claude Code instance managing integration

### Decomposition Strategy

#### Phase 1: Book Analysis & Splitting
1. **PDF Processing**: Split 370-page book into 4 manageable chunks
2. **Alignment**: Each chunk maps to implementation phases
3. **Size Optimization**: Each split under 10MB for AI processing

#### Phase 2: Work Distribution
| Agent | Role | Book Section | Pages | Deliverables |
|-------|------|--------------|-------|--------------|
| 1 | Foundation | Chapters 1-2 | 50 | Tokenizer, Text Processing |
| 2 | Architecture | Chapters 3-4 | 100 | Attention, GPT Model |
| 3 | Training | Chapter 5 | 70 | Pretraining Pipeline |
| 4 | Application | Chapters 6-7 | 150 | Fine-tuning, Instructions |

### Implementation Protocol

#### Agent Instructions Template
```markdown
You are Agent [N] specializing in [DOMAIN].
Your book reference: book_chapters/[SPLIT].pdf
Your modules: [MODULE_LIST]
Your GitHub issues: [ISSUE_NUMBERS]

Instructions:
1. Read your assigned PDF thoroughly
2. Implement modules following book specifications
3. Update GitHub issues with progress
4. Commit frequently with descriptive messages
5. Flag dependencies or blockers immediately
```

#### Coordination Protocol
1. **Morning Sync**: Check all agent progress via issues
2. **Integration Points**: Defined interfaces between modules
3. **Conflict Resolution**: Coordinator resolves merge conflicts
4. **Testing Gates**: Each phase must pass tests before proceeding

### Tmux Session Architecture

```

├── Pane 1: Agent 1 issues (Foundation)
├── Pane 2: Agent 2 issues (Architecture)
└── Pane 3: Agent 3&4 issues (Training/App)

llm-foundation (Agent 1)

└── Pane 1: File monitoring

llm-application (Agent 4)

└── Pane 1: File monitoring
```

### Success Metrics

#### Quantitative
- **Completion Rate**: % of issues closed per phase
- **Integration Success**: Clean merges without conflicts
- **Test Coverage**: >80% per module
- **Time to Complete**: Days per milestone

#### Qualitative
- **Code Quality**: Adherence to Guile conventions
- **Documentation**: Completeness and clarity
- **Book Fidelity**: Accuracy to source material
- **Agent Autonomy**: Minimal coordinator intervention

### Expected Outcomes

#### Week 1
- Foundation modules complete (Agent 1)
- Architecture 50% complete (Agent 2)
- Training design complete (Agent 3)
- Application research complete (Agent 4)

#### Week 2
- Architecture complete (Agent 2)
- Training implementation complete (Agent 3)
- Application 50% complete (Agent 4)
- Initial integration testing

#### Week 3
- All modules complete
- Integration testing passed
- Documentation finalized
- Example applications working

### Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Agent Drift | Medium | High | Clear module boundaries |
| Integration Conflicts | High | Medium | Frequent commits, daily sync |
| Book Ambiguity | Low | High | Cross-reference implementations |
| Guile Limitations | Medium | Medium | Fallback patterns ready |

### Experimental Variables

#### Independent Variables
- Number of agents (4)
- Book decomposition strategy (chapter-based)
- Communication protocol (GitHub issues)

#### Dependent Variables
- Implementation speed
- Code quality
- Integration complexity
- Final system performance

### Data Collection

#### Daily Metrics
- Commits per agent
- Issues closed
- Lines of code
- Test coverage
- Integration conflicts

#### Phase Metrics
- Time to milestone
- Defects found
- Rework required
- Documentation completeness

### Post-Experiment Analysis

#### Questions to Answer
1. Is parallel book decomposition faster than sequential?
2. What is the optimal chunk size for AI agents?
3. How much coordinator overhead is required?
4. What integration patterns work best?
5. Can agents maintain consistency without direct communication?

#### Lessons for Future Projects
- Optimal agent count for book implementation
- Best practices for work decomposition
- Integration strategies for parallel development
- Documentation requirements for multi-agent projects
